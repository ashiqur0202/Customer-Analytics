# Customer Segmentation Project

This project focuses on customer segmentation using clustering algorithms to group customers based on similar attributes and behavior.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to divide our customer base into distinct segments to better understand their needs, preferences, and behaviors. By segmenting customers, we can tailor marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer experiences to specific groups, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and driving business growth.

## Approach

1. **Data Collection**: Gather customer data from various sources, including purchase history, demographic information, and interaction data.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, outliers, and irrelevant attributes.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features from the data and transform them for clustering analysis.

4. **Clustering Analysis**: Apply clustering algorithms such as K-means, hierarchical clustering, or DBSCAN to group customers based on similarities.

5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the quality of the clusters using metrics such as silhouette score, Daviesâ€“Bouldin index, or domain-specific metrics.

6. **Interpretation**: Interpret the resulting clusters and analyze the characteristics of each segment to derive actionable insights.
